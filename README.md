## Introduction

This is a skeleton app that I created to help speed up the developemnt process for new node.js web apps. It uses Backbone.js as the frontend and MongoDB for a persistence database. The 

#### Technologies Used

- [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) - A utility-belt library for JavaScript without extending any of the built-in JavaScript objects.
- [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) - Gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - A fast, concise, library that simplifies how to traverse HTML documents, handle events, perform animations, and add AJAX.
- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - Event-driven I/O server-side JavaScript environment based on V8.
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - High performance, high class web development for node.js.
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) - High performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for node.js.
- [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) - Expressive, dynamic, robust CSS for node.js
- [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) - A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) - A scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database.
- [Jammit](http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/) - Asset packing library ment for Rails, but works great here.
- [Watchr](https://github.com/bevry/watchr) File system watching library that coupled with a simple util script, watches the models, controllers, and client-utils directories for changes and automatically runs jammit to re-compile.
